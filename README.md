# 🌱 My First Website Portfolio

Welcome to my very first project! 🎉  
I’m a beginner software developer, excited to learn and build creative projects while exploring the world of web development.

## 📖 About This Project
This repository is my starting point in coding. Right now, I’m focusing on **Git and GitHub** to understand version control before diving deeper into programming.  

Soon, I’ll be learning and building with:
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**

This portfolio will grow as I improve my skills and create real-world applications. 🚀

## 🚀 Features (Planned)
- Personal introduction page  
- Simple, clean layout with HTML & CSS  
- Interactive elements using JavaScript  
- Portfolio projects section  
- Future updates with React
